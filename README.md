# Whimsical Solfège Chords Studio (MVP)

A tiny, early-stage experiment to teach solfège and chromatic awareness with 12 tone “personalities,” a small on-screen keyboard, and short drills. This is **planning + prototype** work for a course project, not a finished app.

## Why
Some learners prefer quiet, self-paced practice. We want a playful alternative to dry theory: tap a key, hear a tone, meet its “character,” and do a 60–90s drill.

## Initial Goals (Semester)
- Week 1–2: Define tone set (12 chroma), pick colors, draft 1–2 drills
- Week 3–4: Flutter scaffold + a basic keyboard demo
- Week 5–6: Simple “play and match” drill (no mic yet)
- Week 7–8: Save a score locally (SQLite later, JSON first)
- Week 9–10: Polish for demo; add 1 guided “story” lesson

*Stretch (only if time allows):* basic SQLite table for attempts; lightweight animation hook.

## Tech (intended)
- Flutter (stable), Dart
- Local storage: start with JSON, consider SQLite later
- Audio: simple sample playback
- Animation: placeholder images or Rive (stretch)

## Status
Early planning. Wireframes and a keyboard mock are in progress; real audio/animation will come later.

## Running (planned)

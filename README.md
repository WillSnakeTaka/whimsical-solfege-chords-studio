## 🌱 About  
Whimsical Solfège Studio is a tiny, experimental tutor built with **Flutter**.  
Instead of dry theory, every note is a character with color, mood, and story.  

Our solfège is extended beyond the usual seven notes:  

- **White keys (natural tones):**  
  **Do (d), Ze (z), Mi (m), Fa (f), So (s), La (l), Ci (c), Do (d)**  
- **Black keys (chromatic tones):**  
  **A, I, U, E, O**  

Each one gets its own **color, emoji, and personality**.  
Think of it as a *children’s animation meets music pedagogy*.

## ✨ Goals (MVP)  
- 🎹 **On-screen keyboard** with 12 semitones  
- 🧚 **Tone characters** with colors + emojis  
- 📖 **Guided stories** where characters teach intervals  
- 📊 **Simple drills**: play & match, quizzes  
- 💾 **Progress tracking** (start with JSON, move to SQLite later)
